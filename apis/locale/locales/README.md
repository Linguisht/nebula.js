# Locale specific strings

The English resource (string) container [`en-US.json`](./en-US.json) on `master` is monitored for changes. All modifications will automatically be picked up and propagated to the other locale files by the Globalization Services team at Qlik at regular intervals (weekly).

Note: Any changes to non-English files will be overwritten on next translation delivery. If you need to modify the non-English strings for any reason, please contact Qlik Globalization Services via @qlik-oss/globalization.
